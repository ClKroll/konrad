This directory includes several initial atmospheric states:
    * tropical-standard.xml: Standard atmosphere.
    * tropical-convective.xml: Radiative-convective equilibrium.
    * tropical-fixedRH.xml: Radiative equilibrium with fixed rel. humidity.
    * tropical-fixedVMR.xml: Radiative equilibirium with fixed abs. humidity.
    * tropical-moistconvective.xml: Radiative-convective equilibrium
        (moist lapse rate)

The atmospheres in equilibrium are results of simulations over a 3000 day
period using a solar zenith angle of 20 deg and a daytime fraction of 0.4.
